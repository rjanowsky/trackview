"""I/O and basemap-tile provider config for trackview.

Extracted from the trackview monolith (see PLAN.md, Phase 1.6) -- the home of
the map's I/O.  This holds the *tile-provider tables* the map / HTML / gallery
writers fetch from -- the HTTP User-Agent, the per-style tile-URL SOURCES (the
providers, tried in order until one loads) and the matching per-style ATTRIBUTION
lines -- and the basemap fetch itself (_load_basemap: walk those providers,
retrying a transient network failure and skipping blank tiles until one shows
real tiles).  No __file__-relative path (the tile *cache* dir stays in the
monolith, like GPX_DIR).  The --html / --gallery writers still have a back-edge
to the monolith (Phase 1.6-iii / 1.4b-ii); until they move, the monolith
re-imports the three tables plus _load_basemap, since `render` reads them and
calls the fetch.
